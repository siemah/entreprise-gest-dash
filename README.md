In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` 
or maybe you want server side rendering then reach server/ directory and run 
### `node main.js` or from main directory `node  server/main.js` 

Runs the app in the development mode using react-script(exclude SSR).<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>

or using SSR <br>
Open [http://localhost:11111](http://localhost:11111) to view it in the browser.<br>

Inside main diretory run npm run build and copy the build/ directory in server/
